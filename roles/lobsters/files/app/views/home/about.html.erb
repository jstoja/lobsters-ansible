  Lobsters is a technology-focused community centered around link aggregation
  and discussion.
  Launched on July 3rd, 2012, it was created by <a href="/u/jcs">joshua
  stein</a> with some specific design goals in mind to avoid problems faced by
  other link aggregation sites:
  </p>

  <ul>
  <li>a <a href="#tagging">tagging</a> system to categorize and filter
    submissions,
  <li>a user <a href="#invitations">invitation tree</a> to combat spam,
  <li><a href="#downvotes">downvote explanations</a> to curb reflexive
    downvoting,
  <li>a strong commitment to <a href="#transparency">transparency</a>,
  <li>and <a href="#features">many other features</a> that have been added over
  the years.
  </ul>

  <p id="tagging">
  <strong>Tagging</strong>
  <br>
  When links/stories are submitted, they must be tagged by the submitter from a
  list of predefined <a href="/tags">tags</a>.  Users can choose to <a
  href="/filters">filter</a> out all submissions with particular tags, but
  rather than use rigidly segmented sub-forums that users must each subscribe
  to, all users see all stories by default.  The reason for this is threefold:
  </p>

  <ul>
  <li><p>
  It keeps the site on-topic by only allowing a predefined list of tags.
  These tags represent what most of the users of the site want to read, so
  content that does not fit into any of those categories should not be
  submitted.  It also keeps stories organized and more easily searchable.
  </p></li>

  <li><p>
  It promotes discussion.  On a site with separate forums, a Ruby programmer
  would probably subscribe to a Ruby forum, but not a Python one.  When a link
  is posted to the Python forum, that Ruby programmer would probably never see
  it, even though they may have something useful to say about it (perhaps the
  link is about a Python library which does the same thing as a Ruby library
  which that Ruby programmer created).  On this site, the link would get posted
  with a <a href="/t/python" class="tag">python</a> tag and shown to everyone,
  encouraging the Ruby programmer to read and comment on it (unless that Ruby
  programmer disliked Python enough to <a href="/filters">filter</a> it out).
  </p></li>

  <li><p>
  It keeps the conversation centralized.  Often stories contain discussion
  about more than one topic, yet on other sites they are confined to a single
  category/forum, limiting the exposure.  The link could be submitted to more
  than one forum, but then each conversation would remain separate and users
  would rarely interact with users from other forums.  On this site, the story
  would simply be tagged with multiple tags and all users would see all
  discussion about the story in a single location.
  </p></li>
  </ul>

  <p>
  Creating new tags and retiring old tags is done by the community by
  submitting, discussing, and voting on
  <a href="/t/meta" class="tag">meta</a>-tagged requests about them.
  </p>

  <p id="invitations">
  <strong>Invitation Tree</strong><br />
  Invitations are used as a mechanism for spam-control and to encourage users
  to "be nice".  New users must be invited by a current user, though there is
  no vetting process and invitations are not intended to promote exclusivity.
  The most efficient way to receive an invitation is to talk to someone you
  recognize from the site or
  <% if Rails.application.allow_invitation_requests? %>
    <a href="/invitations/request">request one publicly</a>.
  <% else %>
    request one in <a href="/chat">chat</a>.
  <% end %>
  Invitations are unlimited unless scaling problems temporarily prevent new
  accounts.  If spammers are invited to the site and banned, the user that
  invited them may also be banned, going up the chain of invitations as needed.
  </p>

  <p>
  The full <a href="/u">user tree</a> is made public and each user's profile
  shows who invited them.  This provides some degree of accountability and can
  act as a tool to help identify voting rings.
  </p>

  <p id="downvotes">
  <strong>Downvote Explanations</strong><br />
  Often on other sites, a user would have his or her comment downvoted without
  explanation and then edit their comment to ask why they were downvoted.  On
  this site, voters must choose a reason before downvoting comments and those
  votes are tallied and shown to the original commenter.
  </p>
  <p>
  For submitted stories, downvoting is done through flagging (also requiring a
  valid reason) and these flag summaries are shown to all users.
  </p>

  <p id="transparency">
  <strong>Transparency Policy</strong><br>
  All <a href="/moderations">moderator actions</a> on this site are visible to
  everyone and the identities of those moderators are <a
  href="/u?moderators=1">made public</a>.  While the individual actions of a
  moderator may cause debate, there should be no question about which moderator
  it was or whether they had an ulterior motive for those actions.
  </p>

  <p>
  All user voting and story ranking on this site uses a universal algorithm and
  does not <a
  href="http://www.righto.com/2013/11/how-hacker-news-ranking-really-works.html"
  rel="nofollow">artificially penalize</a> or prioritize users or domains.
  Per-tag <a href="/filters">hotness modifiers</a> do affect all stories with
  those tags, but these modifiers are made public and usually used to shorten
  the life of meta-discussions.  If certain domains have to be banned from
  being submitted due to spam, the list will be made publicly available.
  </p>

  <p>
  If users are disruptive enough to warrant banning, they will be banned
  absolutely, given notice of their banning, and their disabled user profile
  will indicate which moderator banned them and why.  There will be no hidden,
  antisocial "shadow banning" or "hellbanning" of users.

  <p id="features">
  <strong>Other Technical Features</strong>
  </p>
  <ul>
  <li><p>
  <strong><a href="/s/jg3eet">Mailing list mode</a></strong> can be enabled
  per-user to receive all new stories (including their plain-text content as
  fetched and extracted by <a href="http://diffbot.com/">Diffbot</a>) and user
  comments as e-mails, mirroring discussion threads offline.  This makes it
  easy and efficient to read new stories as well as keep track of new comments
  on old threads or stories, just like technical mailing lists or Usenet of
  yore.  Each user is assigned a private mailing list address at this domain
  which allows them to reply to stories or comments directly in their e-mail
  client.  These e-mails are then converted and submitted to the website as
  comments, just as if the comment was posted through a web browser.
  </p>

  <li><p>
  <strong>Private messaging</strong> enables users to communicate privately
  without having to publicly disclose an e-mail address, and users can receive
  e-mail and <a href="https://pushover.net/">Pushover</a> notifications of new
  private messages.
  </p></li>

  <li><p>
  <strong>Responsive design</strong> enhances functionality on smaller screens
  such as phones and tablets without having to use a separate URL, 3rd party
  (often read-only) websites, or proprietary mobile applications.
  </p></li>

  <li><p>
  <strong><a href="/search">Integrated search engine</a></strong> covers all
  submitted stories and comments, including full-text caches of all submitted
  story contents.  Searching for a keyword will often bring up relevant stories
  that don't even mention that keyword in the URL or title.
  </p></li>

  <li><p>
  <strong><a href="/s/cqq0kg/story_merging">Story merging</a></strong> combats
  the problem of multiple stories at different URLs being submitted in a short
  timeframe about the same news subject.  Rather than have multiple stories on
  the front page with fragmented discussions, all similar stories can be merged
  into one.  An <a href="/s/klkmey">example</a> of a story having been merged
  into a previous one, combining all comments on one page.
  </p></li>

  <li><p>
  <strong>Fuzzy-matching of submitted story URLs</strong> to avoid duplicate
  submissions of similar URLs that differ only in <tt>http</tt> vs.
  <tt>https</tt>, trailing slashes, useless analytics parameters, etc.  When
  using the story submission bookmarklet, story URLs are automatically
  converted to use the page's canonical URL (if available) to present the best
  URL to represent the story, as defined by the story's author or publisher.
  </p></li>

  <li><p>
  <strong><a href="/s/z2dczs">User-suggested titles and tags</a></strong> can
  be automatically applied to a story when a quorum of users agrees on a new
  title (such as removing a site's name, or appending the story's year of
  publication) or set of tags, without any moderator action required.
  </p></li>

  <li><p>
  <strong><a href="/hats">Hats</a></strong> are a more formal process of
  allowing users to post comments while "wearing <em>such and such</em> hat" to
  give their words more authority (such as an employee speaking for the
  company, or an open source developer speaking for the project).
  </p></li>

  <li><p>
  <strong><a href="/rss">Per-tag and site-wide RSS feeds</a></strong> are
  available to the public and logged-in users have private RSS feeds that
  filter out each user's <a href="/filters">filtered tags</a>.
  </p></li>

  <li><p>
  <strong><a href="https://twitter.com/lobsters">Official Twitter
  mirror</a></strong> posts all stories that have reached the front page to
  the <a href="https://twitter.com/lobsters">@lobsters</a> account on Twitter
  for easy following, retweeting/sharing, or archiving.
  </p></li>
